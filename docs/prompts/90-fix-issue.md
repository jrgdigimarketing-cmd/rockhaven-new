Task

Investigate the issue and implement the smallest possible fix.

Goals:

* Preserve existing architecture.
* Preserve design system.
* Preserve component structure.
* Avoid unnecessary changes.
* Avoid refactoring unrelated code.
* Avoid introducing new components unless absolutely required.

Investigation Process

Before making any changes:

1. Identify files likely involved.
2. Explain what you will inspect.
3. Determine root cause.
4. Confirm root cause before implementing a fix.

Do not guess.

Do not rewrite working code.

---

Fix Strategy

Prefer fixes in this order:

1. Configuration issue
2. Import issue
3. Data issue
4. Component logic issue
5. Styling issue
6. Architecture change (last resort)

Use the smallest change that fully resolves the issue.

Rules

* refactor unrelated code
* modify global styles unless required
* modify design-system.md unless required
