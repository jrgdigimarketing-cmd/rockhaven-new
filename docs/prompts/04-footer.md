Read only:

* docs/design-system.md

Do not inspect unrelated files unless required.

Task:

Build the site's reusable footer system.

Requirements:

* Follow the established design system exactly.
* Reuse existing layout primitives.
* Reuse existing shared components.
* Mobile-first implementation.
* Responsive across all breakpoints.
* Accessibility-friendly.
* Production-ready.
* Optimised for reuse on future brochure websites.

Footer Requirements:

Determine required footer content from the site-map and design system.

Potential content areas may include:

* Logo
* Business summary
* Navigation links
* Services links
* Contact information
* Social links
* Copyright notice
* CTA area

Only include elements supported by the established design system and site structure.

Architecture Rules:

* Footer must be self-contained.
* Avoid hardcoded layout values.
* Use design tokens and shared spacing patterns.
* Use existing button components where applicable.
* Use existing layout primitives.
* Do not duplicate functionality already present elsewhere.

Data Rules:

Where appropriate, pull content from:

* src/lib/data/company.js
* src/lib/data/navigation.js

Create additional data files only if genuinely required.

Avoid:

* Hardcoded company details
* Hardcoded navigation structures
* Duplicate components
* Custom CSS where Tailwind utilities are sufficient
* New design decisions not documented in the design system

Files:

Create or update only the files required for:

* Footer component
* Supporting footer subcomponents (if justified)
* Related data structures (if justified)

After completion:

Update:

* docs/component-registry.md
* docs/project-state.md

Output Format:

1. Summary of approach
2. Files created
3. Files modified
4. Justification for any new components
5. Generated code
6. Documentation updates
